    <h1>Los Galicia</h1>
    <p> my family and I are from Sonsonate, El Salvador, a place with beautiful beaches, where people like to dance Cumbia. I am from a country who practice a lot soccer, from where they celebrate independence day. I am from fireworks to celebrate christmas and new year. I am from a place who have good cultures, I am from torogoz (it looks like a rainbow) from people who live there is call Guanakos. I am from a beautiful environment from a country we have different food like pupusas, tamales, chilate, casamiento and yuca frita. 
        My family and I came to this country to be successful and have a better life.

    <h1>Francisco</h1>
    <p> Iâ€™m proud of my family, also of been at school learning a new language and being a successful student. One talent I have is to be a social person, which will make a lot doors open for my future. What motivates me is my family. One of my goals is be one of the first people from my family to go college and get a degree. I also like to do the assembles at my school. I like to do sound tech and be the manager for the assemblies at my school.
