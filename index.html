Francisco Galicia = bold

I am from Sonsonate, El Salvador, a place with beautiful beaches, where people like to dance Cumbia, practice a lot of soccer, and celebrate Christmas and New Year with fireworks. I am from Torogoz, a beautiful environment with great food like pupusas, tamales, chilate, casamiento, and yuca frita.

My family and I came to this country to be successful and have a better life.  About myself, Iâ€™m proud of my family, also of been at school learning a new language and being a successful student.  One talent I have is to be a social person, which will make a lot of doors open for my future. What motivates me is my family.  One of my goals is be one of the first people from my family to go to college and get a degree. I also like to do sound tech and be the manager for the assemblies at my school.
